I like to solve problems and learn new things. Working in IT allows me to do both and get paid for it.

10+ years of experience in software development, hovering around cloud, automation, DevOps and security, which I'm currently quite passionate about.

I had the pleasure of working on a multitude of projects in all stages of their lifecycle, across various technology stacks, project, team and company sizes. This gradually allowed me to see more of the bigger picture in using technology to improve business.

However, I still like to get my hands dirty and plan to post here about my adventures with code.
