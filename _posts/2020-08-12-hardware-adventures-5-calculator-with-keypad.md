# Making a better calculator in hardware

https://appcodelabs.com/read-matrix-keypad-using-arduino

The principle is straightforward: you put a signal on one of the columns and proceed to read all of the rows in turn. If the signal appears on any of the rows then you know that rows is connected to the column you put the signal on, so the key at the intersection of that row and column must be pressed. If there was no signal, try the next column, and so on, until youâ€™ve tried all the columns.

This process is called a matrix scan. TODO describe

We also need to enable builtin [pull-down resistors](TODO Wikipedia link) on the row pins in order to ensure a known state (logical zero) when a button is not pressed.

## Entering multiple digits

How do we know that the user has pressed and released a button? By using a signal that indicates if anything is pressed.
Then whenever a new `OutputReady` (TODO rename) signal comes in, we can read it.
However, we also have to think about timing issues - maybe we have to "clear" the keypad input so don't read the button multiple times if the user keeps holding a button for multiple scanning periods.

TODO link state machine for reading the digits

I think the best way is to have a binary internal representation. This will need to be updated after every keypress to do 
reg_arg*=10; reg_arg+=N. We could avoid multiplication by doing `reg_arg * 8 + reg_arg * 2`, which can be implemented by binary shift. But as my FPGA has a few hardware multipliers, let's just do multiplication in VHDL.

then convert to BCD for display on the 7-seg display.

3-digit BCD to binary: 
- take digit 1 and resolve to 1,2,3,...
- take digit 2 and resolve to 10,20,30,...
- take digit 3 and resolve to 100,200,300,...
- add results together

We need `ceil(log2(pow(10, N)))` bits to represent N digits. If we want to represent signed numbers, we need one bit more to be safe. In our case with 3 digits, `ceil(log2(pow(10, 3))) = 10`, so we need 10 bits for unsigned 3-digit number (range 0-1023).

### Decoding the keypad

### Reading the keypad

I've been stuck on how to properly read the keypad for some time - this was planned to be titled `Hardware Adventures 5`, not `9`, after all.

Although I've found multiple descriptions for a single button debouncer, I didn't understand how to do it over multiple possible columns that we scan and I attempted to insert some kind of debounce circuit running at a lower frequency *after* the keypad decoder, hoping it would settle on a decoded number - somehow it didn't.

What finally helped was this [assignment](http://www.tkt.cs.tut.fi/kurssit/1426/S12/Ex/ex3/ex3.html) from a Tampere University that described the key poller and debouncer for the students. It describes an algorithm that probes the column successively, and for each column it waits for an input.

I could make the wait and hold times configurable, so it can be tuned to a specific keypad.

### The calculator state machine

TODO link to the diagram rendering

### Multiplication

TODO Added multiplication. Why not division? Because I'm lazy to integrate a pipelined divider - all of my other logic operates in a single clock cycle.

### Division
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40312206/algorithm-for-divison

The simplest algorithm of all is [division by repeated subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm#Division_by_repeated_subtraction):

```
while N = D do
  N := N - D
  Q := Q + 1
end
R := N
return (Q,R)
```

This translates to a fairly simple verilog.

Integrating divider

As it will run for a various number of clocks, we need to signal the parent module somehow that the division is completed:

We assign the divider inputs, signal it to `start` and transition into a waiting state:
```
end else begin //OP_DIVIDE
	divider_start <= 1'b1;
	numerator <= reg_result;
	denominator <= reg_arg;
	state <= state_dividing;
end
```

Then we continuously poll the `done` signal. If it's asserted, we move over to the common display result state.

```
state_dividing:
begin
    divider_start <= 1'b0;
    if(divider_done)
    begin
        reg_result <= quotient;
        state <= state_display_result;
    end
end
```





### Stupid errors

> I forgot again to connect a top module input to a pin. This will produce a cryptic message.

Note: keypad now doesn't read zero!! we need a flag that will distinguish legitimate zero from a non-press.

#### boo
Verilog doesn't tell you when you make a typo and wire a module to something nonexistent.  IO_P4_ROW as IO_DP4_ROW

#### clock
Work on one clock, not multiples
