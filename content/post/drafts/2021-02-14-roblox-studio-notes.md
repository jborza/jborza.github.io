### SpawnLocation as a starting point

In Roblox, a SpawnLocation marks where a player appears in the world at the start of the game or after restarting. Without a spawn location, players might spawn in the middle of nowhere and fall to their doom.

>In the Explorer window, hover your mouse over Workspace.
>Click the circle button.
>Scroll through the drop-down list until you find SpawnLocation and click on it.

### Placing parts and anchoring

Parts are created at the center of the camera view. They are aligned to **studs** as the basic measurement unit. 

**Anchoring** locks parts in place and stops them from moving - or gravity.

`F` focuses camera on a selected part - this is useful as a starting point for placing a new block.

### Tools

https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Tool

Tools are objects that a Humanoid object can equip. For players, they are stored in a Backpack object parented to a Player object. In-game, players may have multiple tools which appear as icons at the bottom of the screen. Equipping a tool moves it from the Backpack and into a playerâ€™s Character|character model in the Workspace. 

Creating a tool:
- create a Tool in StarterPack
- add an object named Handle (case sensitive)

Sword Tool Example was useful from the Tool reference - with standard slash animation

### Ray casting:

https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Raycasting

If the raycasting operation hits an eligible `BasePart` or `Terrain` cell, a `RaycastResult` object is returned containing the results. To test for a hit, simply check that `raycastResult` is not `nil` and utilize the following [properties](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Raycasting) (Instance, Position, Material, Normal) as needed.

```lua
    ...
    local raycastParams = RaycastParams.new()
	raycastParams.FilterDescendantsInstances = {caster.Parent}
	raycastParams.FilterType = Enum.RaycastFilterType.Blacklist
    local raycastResult = workspace:Raycast(rayOrigin, rayDirection, raycastParams)
    ...

	if raycastResult then
        local hitPart = raycastResult.Instance
```

Or:

```lua
-- Get current tile
local ray = Ray.new(character.HumanoidRootPart.Position, Vector3.new(0,-100,0))
local part, position, normal = game.Workspace:FindPartOnRay(ray, character) 
```



### Threading and wait()

https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Threading-Code

Code threading is a method that allows two or more pieces of code to run at once. Threading becomes necessary when, for example, you want to run two while loops simultaneously.

In Roblox, the `spawn()` function can be used to start a function in a new thread:

```lua
    local function thread1()
    	while true do 
    		print("Loop 1") 
    		wait()
    	end
    end
     
    spawn(thread1)
```

### Proximity prompts

https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/proximity-prompts

On-screen prompts are generated by a `ProximityPrompt` object parented to an `Attachment`, `BasePart`, or `Model`.

### Start button:

```lua
local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

local buttonScreen = script.ScreenGui
startFrame = buttonScreen.StartButtonFrame
startButton = buttonScreen.StartButtonFrame.StartButton
startGamepad = buttonScreen.StartButtonFrame.StartGamepad

buttonScreen.Parent = player:WaitForChild("PlayerGui")

wait()
local connection

startButton.Visible = true
connection = startButton.MouseButton1Click:connect(function()
    startFrame:TweenPosition(UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 1.5, 0), "In", "Back", 0.5)

    game.ReplicatedStorage.Events.StartRunning:FireServer(player)
    connection:disconnect()
end)
```
