### TODO - memory bus

Look at https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~bim/notes/fcde/assign/example.html

### TODO - keypad

I'd like to reuse a debounced 4x4 keypad module from the [Calculator project]({% post_url  2020-11-21-hardware-adventures-9-calculator-with-keypad %}).

We could either connect them directly to IO lines of the CPU. Because CHIP-8 instructions check the key presses against a value in VX, we could either choose to store one bit per key (and allow multiple keypresses) or just store the most recently pressed key in a 4-bit internal register.
