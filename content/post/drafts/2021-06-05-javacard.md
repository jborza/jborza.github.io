Maybe use the KVM Virtual machine to run on an Arduino/ESP?

An applet on the card remains inactive until it is explicitly selected. The terminal sends a "SELECT APDU" command to JCRE. JCRE suspends the currently selected applet and invokes the applet's deselect method to perform any necessary cleanup. JCRE then marks the applet whose AID is specified in the "SELECT APDU" command as the currently selected applet and calls the newly selected applet's select method. The select method prepares the applet to accept APDU commands. JCRE dispatches the subsequent APDU commands to the currently selected applet until it receives the next "SELECT APDU" command.

A Java Card applet is compiled using a regular Java compiler. The output of the compiler (a class file) is input into a Java Card converter which enforces Java Card 2.0 subset compliance, performs name resolution and initial address linking, and optimizes the Java byte code to be suitably running on a Java Card VM. The output of the converter can then be downloaded onto a Java Card. The details of the converter and applet installation protocols aren't discussed in this article because they haven't yet been standardized. We hope to cover these areas in future article.

This article begins with an overview of smart cards and a brief review of ISO 7816, the smart card standard.

Normally, a smart card does not contain a power supply, a display, or a keyboard. It interacts with the outside world using the serial communication interface via its eight contact points. The dimensions and location of the contacts are covered in part 2 of ISO 7816. This diagram shows the contacts on a smart card.

. Similarly, smart cards speak to the outside world using their own data packages -- called APDU (Application Protocol Data Units). APDU contains either a command or a response message. In the card world, the master-slave model is used whereby a smart card always plays the passive role. In other words, a smart card always waits for a command APDU from a terminal. It then executes the action specified in the APDU and replies to the terminal with a response APDU. Command APDUs and response APDUs are exchanged alternatively between a card and a terminal.

The following tables illustrate command and response APDU formats, respectively. APDU structure is described in ISO 7816, part 4.

Mandatory Header	Conditional Body
CLA	INS	P1	P2	Lc	Data field	Le
The header codes the selected command. It consists of four fields: class (CLA), instruction (INS), and parameters 1 and 2 (P1 and P2). Each field contains 1 byte:

CLA: Class byte. In many smart cards, this byte is used to identify an application.
INS: Instruction byte. This byte indicates the instruction code.
P1-P2: Parameter bytes. These provide further qualification to the APDU command.

 Java Card applications are called applets. Multiple applets can reside on one card. Each applet is identified uniquely by its AID (application identifier), as defined in ISO 7816, part 5.

 The Java Card lifetime starts when the native OS, Java Card VM, API classes libraries and optionally, applets are burned into ROM. This process of writing the permanent components into the non-mutable memory of a chip for carrying out incoming commands is called masking.
