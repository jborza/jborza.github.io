I like to solve problems and learn new things. Working in IT allows me to do both and get paid for it.

With 18 years of experience in software development, hovering around cloud, automation, DevOps and security I had the pleasure of working on a multitude of projects in all stages of their lifecycle, across various technology stacks, project, team and company sizes. This gradually allowed me to see more of the bigger picture in using technology to improve business.

I currently work as an engineering manager, which is fun with a whole entire new set of challenges, but I still like to get my hands dirty and blog here about my adventures with code.
